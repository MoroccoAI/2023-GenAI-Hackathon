# Mokawil .AI ü§ñüíºüá≤üá¶



## Problem
Starting and managing a business in Morocco is challenging for entrepreneurs and aspiring business owners due to a lack of access to reliable information. Many struggle with the complexities of setting up a company, understanding tax requirements, and grasping Morocco-specific business terminology.
[Business failures in Morcco skyrocketed in 2022, rising by 17.4% compared to 2021.](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2023/01/353639/more-than-12-000-moroccan-businesses-failed-in-2022)

## Intorducing Mokawil.AI

Mokawil .AI is the first-of-its-kind GenAI-powered chatbot designed to assist entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs in starting their businesses in Morocco. It has access to specific information covering everything from creating a company, running it, understanding when and how much to pay taxes, business terminology in Morocco, and much more.


## Approach:

We utilized the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our generative AI models. RAG optimizes the output of a large language model by referencing an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response.

The main tool we employed for making the RAG is [Langchain ü¶úÔ∏è‚õìÔ∏è](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) for performence and simplicity .

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Embedding
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gathered detailed blogs on entrepreneurship,taxes,and everything related to starting a company from  [BHAdviser](https://bhadviser.org/blog/).

2. **Embedding:**
   - Utilized a model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2) to transform data into vector representation.

3. **Vector Storage:**
   - Stored embeddings in the vector database [FAISS](https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/).

### Phase 2: User Interaction
1. **User Interaction:**
   - Users input prompts through the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) interface.

2. **Prompt Embedding:**
   - Embedded user prompts using the same model used for data embedding.

3. **Similarity Search:**
   - Compared embedded user prompts with vector database data to find the best match.

### Phase 3: Large Language Model (LLM)
1. **LLM Selection:**
   - Utilized the [Mistral-7B-OpenOrca](https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca) language model, incorporating [Q4 quantization](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GGUF).

2. **Answers Generation:**
   - Fed results of similarity search to the LLM to generate answers based on user-specific needs and available information the answer are also saved in chat memroy to make use of them later .

3. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Presented answers in the Streamlit UI for user consumption.
