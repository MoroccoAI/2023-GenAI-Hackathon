# 2023-GenAI-Hackathon

The MoroccoAI Generative AI Hackathon aims to foster innovation and collaboration within Morocco's burgeoning AI ecosystem. As a participant, you are asked to use the latest GenAI advances to build cutting edge solutions to solve business problems in specific industries. You can join a team to develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) involving an API, a mobile application, or a web application aimed at addressing a real-life problem in Education, Healthcare, Environment, Finance or Customer Services.

Over the span of 7 days, starting from December 11th to 17th 2023, you will collaborate with a team to transform your idea into a PoC. Throughout this period, you'll receive guidance and assistance to refine your idea, identify potential team members, and/or evaluate specific functionalities within your current solution.
