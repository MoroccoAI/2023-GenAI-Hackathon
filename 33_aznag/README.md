## Abstract

### Background and Problem Statement

In a diverse linguistic landscape, ensuring access to information in local languages is crucial for effective communication. The challenge arises when English documents serve as primary sources of information, hindering comprehension for non-English speakers. This project addresses the need for an Intelligent AI FAQ that answers questions in Moroccan Dialect, using English documents as a knowledge base.


### Impact and Proposed Solution

Our Intelligent AI FAQ system is designed to bridge the language gap by providing accurate and contextually relevant responses in Moroccan Dialect. The impact lies in democratizing access to information, fostering inclusivity, and empowering users to engage with content in their native language. By leveraging advanced natural language processing, the solution ensures a seamless and culturally sensitive conversational experience.

## Project Outcomes and Deliverables

- **Language Accessibility:** Users can interact with English document-based content in Moroccan Dialect, expanding the reach of valuable information.
- **Contextual Understanding:** The system preserves the contextual meaning of English documents, delivering precise and culturally appropriate responses.
- **User Engagement:** Increased user engagement through a responsive and user-friendly Intelligent AI FAQ system.

## Multilingual Support

Our Intelligent AI FAQ system is designed with extensibility in mind. While currently tailored for Moroccan Dialect, there is a possibility to extend its language support to address a broader audience. The modular architecture allows for the integration of additional language models, making it adaptable to diverse linguistic requirements.
